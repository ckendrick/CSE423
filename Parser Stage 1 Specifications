Overview:
The objectives of the Stage 1 Parser:
-Take the Grammer and Tokens and determine the correctness of the two
-Convert Tokens into a format that is easily convertable to a parse tree
-Pass data for parse tree function that will be completed elsewhere

Inputs: Tokens, Vector/ Grammer, Vector of Conversion Structures

Actions: Verify Grammer on Tokens, store in Vectors

Exit Conditions: Error for Tokens failing, unrecoverable. Successful creation of Vectors

Returns: 1 Vector that preserves the priority and order of the tokens after being parsed through the grammer.
  
struct ParsedToken {
  std::string name;
  enum token type;
  bool trep;
  int priority;
  int children;
};
