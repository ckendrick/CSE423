## Tokenizer
The tokenizer works by reading in a source file, storing those contents as a string object, and passing that string to a tokenizer function to be split into tokens stored in a vector object.
The tokenizer function utilizes a struct called token_t, which contains a string for the token contents and an enumerator with the general type of token it is (string, keyword, etc.). To parse
out tokens from the source file string, regex is employed.
